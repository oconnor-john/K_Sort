# K_Sort
Simple ML model using a K-sort clustering algorithim

Why I did this?
It all started with a class project. As opposed to chosing a simple statistics concept - I took on the idea of creating a clustering algorithim as they are fundamental in unsupervised machiene learning algorithms.
Upon submitting the project I knew the data was sorted but that was it - no way to see what happened. Thats where I implemented the matplotlib library to create a tailored graph to visualize the clusters found through the alogorithm.
